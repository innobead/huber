**Huber** is to simplify the package management from GitHub projects with a builtin awesome list (live updating) of popular projects. It also supports *repository* feature for managing the package installation from your personal Github project. Please check the complete introduction as below.

> `Huber is a (new) tool for easy installation of dev/ops CLI tools directly from GitHub. No more trawling the releases pages!` introduced by [Coffee and Cloud Native - 88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgA6hpKdncw)

- Manages released artifacts from github, and decide which version as the current to use
- Manages the default package repository with an awesome package list including popular star github projects (ex: K8s, K3s, cloud-native, etc)
- Supports `huber.yaml` in any public/private github repo aware to Huber to manage the described packages
- Supports secure protocols (`SSH`/`HTTPS`) for github communication
- Supports cross platforms
  - Linux x86_64/amd64
  - Linux arm64/aarch64
  - Linux arm-v7
  - MacOS x86_64/amd64
  - Windows x86_64/amd64

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Please install necessary dependent libraries on the supported platforms to make sure huber work as expected. Use appropriate OS package manager to install the dependencies. 

### Linux (usually installed already)

```console
# Ubuntu
‚ùØ apt install libssl-dev libarchive-dev

# openSUSE
‚ùØ zypper install libopenssl-devel libarchive-devel

# CentOS
‚ùØ dnf install openssl-devel libarchive-devel
```

### MacOS

```console
‚ùØ brew install libarchive
‚ùØ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/libarchive/lib/pkgconfig
‚ùØ brew install openssl
```

### Windows

Please install [libarchive](https://www.libarchive.org/), which can be installed with Cygwin, MinGW (`pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libarchive`) or Vcpkg (`vcpkg install libarchive`).

For vcpkg, you can refer to [vcpkg#quick-start-windows](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows).

## Installing Huber

### Installing the official version

For official releases, please install the latest release as below command. After the installation, `huber` will be automatically added to the environment path by updating the`$HOME/.bashrc`. 
But, if it does not work as expected, please remember to add `$HOME/.huber/bin` in the environment path, so `huber` will be looked up correctly. 

```console
# Cargo
‚ùØ cargo install huber

# Linux
‚ùØ curl -sfSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/innobead/huber/master/hack/install.sh | bash

# Windows
‚ùØ . { iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/innobead/huber/master/hack/windows/install.ps1 } | iex; install
```

### Installing the development version

For Linux or Mac users, follow below steps to prepare the environment.

```console
# Setup development environment
‚ùØ make set-dev

# Install huber in $HOME/.cargo/bin, $HOME/.huber/bin and update ~/.bashrc
‚ùØ make install
```

For Windows users, follow below steps to prepare the environment.

1. Download VS 2019 build tool installer, and install C++ development toolchain
2. Pull vcpkg git repo (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), then do bootstrapping via `./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`
3. Run `./hack/windows/setup-dev.ps1`
